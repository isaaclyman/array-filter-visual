# array-filter-visual

To set up:

```bash
npm install
npm install -g @vue/cli@latest
```

Then replace the array in `words.js` with any array of strings that you choose.

To run:

```bash
vue serve visual.vue
```

Then visit `localhost:8080` in the browser (or whatever URL the vue-cli tells you it's hosting at).

Select or deselect items in the array and the JavaScript array at the bottom of the page will be updated, ready to be copied and pasted into your code.
